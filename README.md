# YouTube-Replay-Count
Implements a counter which tracks the number of re-watches on YouTube videos. Runs with Tampermonkey (or equivalent).

Honestly, I (still) can't be bothered to figure out how GreasyFork works, so just copy-paste the contents of the YoutubeListAbort.txt file into a new Tampermonkey script if you want to use it.
